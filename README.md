I WILL NOT LET THIS PLUGIN DIE AS LONG AS I LIVE Ars Magna#2472 ON DISCORD IF DEAD

FFXIV Dalamud plugin to turn everyone into Lalafells

Smol update by Ars Magna for to run in 6.1 - Also updated for 6.2 now 

Add custom repo to Dalamud for use it if want while out of date, worksing real goodly

I am officially dead, if I ever play FFXIV again I'll update this but for now it is in the hands of the angels 
It probably just needs to have the addresses in SigScanner fixed and rebuilt but maybe needs other adaptations as dalamud matures more and more every day
Have fun!
